# Reasearch_Repository
A research repository for college

I will be using this repository to collect various bits of code that i have found intersting or have helped me learn.
I also plan to build a game while teaching myself pygame using code from a text game i previously built.
This will also help me gain more confindence in using github.


# README UPDATE
Pygame ended up being alot more complicated than I first thought!, So i decided to do a video tutorial on making a simple spaceship shooting game.
It was quite fun and gave me a good appreciation of whats possible with pygame, It was a follow along tutorial so not my own code, but was written by me if that makes sense.
I have included the code for my simple fighting game i made while teaching myself OOP, it's not close to being finished but i am looking forward to going back over it and refactoring it with what i have learnt this term.

I also plan to build a web scraper as a personal project, the company i work for has a terrible stock taking system, my goal is to buil a web scraper that connects to my stock excel sheets and updates the price of goods we're buying in automaticly.
Not sure how realistic this idea is but will be a good project to try and push my knowledge further, so have included the beginning code of a tutorial i am doing.
