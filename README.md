# Reasearch_Repository
A research repository for college

I will be using this repository to collect various bits of code that i have found intersting or have helped me learn.
I also plan to build a game while teaching myself pygame using code from a text game i previously built.
This will also help me gain more confindence in using github.


# README UPDATE
Pygame ended up being alot more complicated than I first thought!, So i decided to do a video tutorial on making a simple spaceship shooting game.
It was quite fun and gave me a good appreciation of whats possible with pygame, It was a floow along tutorial so not my own code, but was written by me if that makes sense.
I have included the code for my simple fighting game i made while teaching myself OOP, it's not close to being finished nut i am looking forward to going back over it and refactoring it with what i have learnt this term.
